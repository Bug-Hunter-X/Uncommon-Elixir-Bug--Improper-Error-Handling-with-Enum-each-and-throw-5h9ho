This repository demonstrates a potential issue with error handling in Elixir when using `Enum.each` and the `throw` macro. The `bug.ex` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.ex` provides a more robust solution.  The issue arises from the abrupt termination of `Enum.each` when an error occurs.  The improved solution uses `try-catch` for more controlled error handling within the loop.
